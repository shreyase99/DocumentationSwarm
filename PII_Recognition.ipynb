It's really hurts when your 17k investment goes down the drain. If you are interested in wasting money please go ahead. Customer care number 08001004540 that doesn't respond or pick calls. The funny part such a big brand has only one helpline number I should hv got the doubt when purchasing it. It's one of the best product I have ever used. It tells me much to walk it even has gps and even tracks few other exercise. The best part is the Heart beat When I am running on the treadmill I kW how much faster I got to run to hit the fat burn rate. 2 negative Sometimes the steps taken are not actuate No Indian food list to tract your calories.\n",

Means from calling call centre of bajaj for installation to service man reached at my home was just about 30 min on the date of delivery itself. SUPERFAST INSTALLATION SERVICE BY BAJAJ. THANK YOU :) Now let me clear some minor things about this geyser. 1 - INSTALLATION is FREE 2 - TWO PIPES are also FREE with this geyser model 3 - service man will only charge for thin pin plug 60 rs & fasteners for 40 rs, total 100rs. no extra charge. 4 - PIPES are not inside the box which you received, they will be brought up by service man at the time of installation. NOTE - IF service man asked for installation fees and pipe fees, you direct call at bajaj customer care number 02241280000 (JAGO GARHAK JAGO) i have attached the pipes photo too, they are original from bajaj company. my geyser installation took around 10 min to install. everything was quick nd perfect :) also working perfectly :) THANK YOU BAJAJ :)\n",
            "6877 6.0 ,  Within few weeks, product stopped working.

There is no absorbency , the leakage in the diaper is on very very high level, along with the softness is on its worst ever. It doesn't seem to be a Himalaya product.
